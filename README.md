# EPT-PRJ-TX-Line-Design
### Created as a project for EE-352 Electrical Power Transmission as part of the BE-Electrical Engineering program at NEDUET

## Overview
A MATLAB GUI-based program that chooses electrical and selected mechanical parameters of power transmission lines based on user requirements such as 
- transmission voltage in kV
- transmission distance in km
- preferred transmission geometry.
